Visual Sorting Algo iOS App

In this Sorting Algo app,
Sorting functions calls the GraphView.swift where all the sorting
functions are written and generation of random numbers takes place.
Draw method utilizes those values and draw the bar graph accordingly.
GraphView has drawing logic, random number generating function. And
those are then pass through the Sorting function of the Algo. Which
gives sorted array.
